# ArenaDuel
**The lightweight, risk-free dueling solution for Survival Multiplayer (SMP) servers.**

## 🗡️ What is ArenaDuel?
SimpleDuel is a straightforward plugin designed for SMP servers where players want to settle scores or practice PvP without the fear of losing their hard-earned gear. Unlike complex KitPvP plugins, ArenaDuel lets players fight with their own inventory.
When a duel starts, players are teleported to your custom arena. When the duel ends, the loser keeps their items and XP, but drops their Head as a trophy for the winner!


## ✨ Key Features

Bring Your Own Gear: No kits. Players fight with whatever armor and weapons they have in their inventory.
Safe Death: If you die in a duel, you keep your inventory and levels.
Trophy System: The loser drops their player head (skull) for the winner to collect.
Immersive Countdown: 5-second countdown with sound effects. Players are frozen in place (but can look around) until the fight starts.
Arena Protection: Players are automatically switched to Adventure Mode during the duel to prevent arena griefing.
Leaderboard: Built-in stats system. Type /duel top to see who dominates the server.
Zero Dependencies: Just drag and drop into your plugins folder.
